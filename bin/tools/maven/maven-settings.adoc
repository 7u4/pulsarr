For developers in China, we suggest you add aliyun maven mirror to your global maven settings to accelerate the building.

On linux, the path of the global maven settings is:

    ~/.m2/settings.xml

On Windows,

    C:\Users\{username}\.m2\settings.xml

If the file doesn't exist, just copy link:settings.xml[settings.xml] to the proper directory.

    cp bin/tools/maven/settings.xml ~/.m2/

If the file exists, add the following code to the file:

    <mirror>
        <id>alimaven</id>
        <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
        <name>aliyun maven</name>
        <url>https://maven.aliyun.com/nexus/content/repositories/central/</url>
    </mirror>
